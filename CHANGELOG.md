# Changelog

All notable changes to Cate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Panel full screen**: focus a canvas panel in an overlay that fills the canvas without resizing it over its neighbors. Toggle with ⌘F (or the panel Full Screen control); Esc exits. Find in a text editor still uses ⌘F.
- **Panel switcher**: hold ⌃Tab to pick another canvas panel from a macOS-style strip, then release to focus it. The canvas camera follows each highlighted panel so it is on screen when you land. Works while a panel is full screen.

### Changed

- Saved sessions that used the old in-canvas maximize restore those panels to their original size so they no longer cover neighbors.

## [1.6.1-beta.2] - 2026-08-19

This beta makes browser panels faster and more reliable across canvas, focus, and workspace changes.

### Changed

- **Persistent webview rendering**: browser panels now use connected Electron webviews instead of native browser views, preserving page state while panels move between active and background workspaces.

### Fixed

- **Background browser automation**: browser commands keep working while a panel is unfocused or its workspace is inactive, with faster and more reliable target binding.
- **Browser sizing and overlays**: browser surfaces track panel resize, canvas pan, and zoom correctly so content and automation overlays stay aligned.
- **Workspace state retention**: switching away and back no longer reloads browser pages or clears live form state.

## [1.6.1-beta.1] - 2026-08-13

This beta opens Cate's coding-agent orchestration to terminal-based agents, improves agent follow-ups, and hardens Windows workspace paths.

### Added

- **Recursive agent orchestration through Cate CLI**: terminal agents can create, inspect, message, wait for, review, apply, keep, discard, and stop visible coding-agent workers, including nested workers and isolated worktrees.
- **Agent CLI permissions**: Settings now exposes separate read and control permissions for coding-agent orchestration.

### Changed

- **Shared orchestration contract**: Cate Agent now uses the public Cate CLI workflow instead of a private orchestration tool, so built-in and terminal-based agents manage the same workers.
- **OpenCode follow-ups**: running OpenCode workers can receive additional instructions through the shared agent workflow.
- **Updated skills and document support**: refreshed the bundled skills index and updated PDF and YAML dependencies.

### Fixed

- **Windows network-drive workspaces**: mapped and UNC paths are normalized and validated consistently when opening workspaces and saving sessions.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-07

Cate 1.6 brings agent mission orchestration, native browser automation, safer remote workspaces, and a more reliable terminal and agent experience.

### Added

- **Agent mission orchestration**: Cate Agent can plan work, delegate tasks to coding agents in isolated worktrees, monitor them in the background, review results, and clean up completed missions.
- **Agent-ready browser controls and credential profiles**: automation can inspect and operate native browser panels, manage tabs and dialogs, capture screenshots, and use saved credentials without exposing secrets to page scripts.
- **Flexible agent workspaces**: unified chats can move between the sidebar and panels, multiple custom AI providers are supported, and workspace commands are available from the command palette.

### Changed

- **Native browser foundation**: browser panels now use native views and a consolidated agent-browser command surface with stronger authorization and panel targeting.
- **Remote workspace transport**: remote connections use the system OpenSSH client for better compatibility with existing SSH configuration and authentication.
- **Safer, clearer automation**: Cate CLI permissions are split by capability, workspace trust protects repo-controlled layouts, and worktree-aware setup keeps agent configuration consistent across checkouts.

### Fixed

- **Agent startup and recovery**: stopped or failed Cate Agent sessions can be recreated cleanly, restored sessions retain their lifecycle state, Windows hooks launch reliably, and obsolete managed subagent installs no longer cause duplicate-tool failures.
- **Terminal rendering and sizing**: new terminals receive their real dimensions, split panes retain focus, and zoom or display-density changes no longer leave unstable glyph sizing or rendering artifacts.
- **Workspace and canvas reliability**: remote paths are validated, worktree failures roll back cleanly, moved panels survive canvas closure, and interrupted gestures no longer leave canvas input stuck.

## [1.6.0-beta.3] - 2026-07-26

This beta sharpens browser automation, workspace navigation, remote safety, and agent status reporting.

### Added

- **Browser automation controls**: agents and the Cate CLI can inspect pages, manage tabs, enter trusted input, evaluate scripts, read console output, handle dialogs, and capture screenshots through a smaller, clearer command surface.
- **Workspace navigation commands**: the command palette can switch directly between workspaces, backed by repaired workspace keyboard shortcuts.

### Changed

- **Clearer Cate CLI workflows**: the command set and skill guidance now focus on the supported browser, terminal, file, and panel workflows.
- **More reliable agent status**: running and waiting states now follow the coding-agent lifecycle more consistently.

### Fixed

- **Remote workspace path validation**: relative remote paths are rejected before they can resolve against an unintended directory.

## [1.6.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-25

Browser panels gain agent-ready controls and secure credential profiles.

### Added

- **Browser control API**: automation can navigate, inspect, click, type, and capture browser panels without relying on page-specific integrations.
- **Credential profiles**: saved browser credentials can be imported, selected, filled, and cleared through the host UI without exposing secrets to page scripts.

### Fixed

- **Portable browser storage**: SQLite-backed browser history and credential features load only on supported targets, preventing startup failures elsewhere.

## [1.6.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-24

Major agent, workspace, terminal, and security improvements for the 1.6 beta cycle.

### Added

- **Unified Cate Agent chats**: chats are workspace-owned, can be shared between sidebar and panel hosts, and survive moving between views.
- **Multiple custom AI providers**: configure and choose more than one OpenAI-compatible provider.
- **Worktree-aware agent setup**: agent configuration and hooks work consistently from the main checkout and linked worktrees.

### Changed

- **Safer workspace trust**: untrusted repositories cannot restore or autosave repo-controlled layouts until the user explicitly trusts them.
- **Themeable wallpaper scrim**: themes can control the contrast layer above canvas backgrounds.

### Fixed

- **Terminal rendering and focus**: split terminals keep focus, and GPU rendering artifacts recover without manual resizing.
- **Worktree actions**: failures are surfaced cleanly and closing a canvas preserves panels that were moved elsewhere.
- **Canvas gestures**: input no longer remains stuck when a gesture target unmounts.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Browsable extension catalog**: extensions can be explored by category, searched, and paged instead of appearing as one flat list.

### Changed

- **Shared Cate Agent pickers**: the composer now reuses the standard model and worktree pickers for consistent selection behavior.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-21

Agent automation release centered on durable hook-driven status, explicit CLI permissions, extension URL mode, and cross-platform release reliability.

### Added

- **Unified agent hooks**: supported coding agents report lifecycle, permission, and needs-input events through one hook system, with state surviving app restarts.
- **Cate CLI permission matrix**: read and control capabilities can be granted independently, with a dedicated terminal command group and per-feature settings.
- **URL-mode extensions**: extension panels can load a declared URL and still participate in off-screen culling.
- **Grok support and centralized agent registry**: Grok joins the supported agents, with shared metadata and detection policy.

### Changed

- **Non-disruptive Cate automation**: CLI-driven actions avoid stealing focus or disturbing the active workspace.
- **Detached window chrome**: detached-window controls share the dock tab-bar row for a more compact layout.

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform release builds**: deterministic installs and a Windows runtime fix unblock builds with newer Visual Studio toolchains.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Workspace and input hardening**: workspace transitions, gesture cleanup, and related input edge cases are more defensive.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-15

Stable release of the 1.4 beta cycle, introducing the redesigned Cate Agent, extension platform, agent-facing Cate CLI, and major shell/navigation updates.

### Fixed

- **macOS fullscreen sidebar**: the traffic-light inset collapses correctly when the left sidebar enters fullscreen.

## [1.4.0-beta.6] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Focus retention**: panels and dialogs keep keyboard focus through common click, drag, and overlay transitions.
- **Canvas and docking polish**: corrected split rendering, tab-drop previews, sidebar chrome, and window-close quit guards.
- **Agent model compatibility**: provider catalog changes no longer break the available-model list.

### Changed

- **Editor and terminal overlays**: the Markdown toggle floats over the editor, while terminal search no longer collides with the worktree chip.

## [1.4.0-beta.5] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Three-state sidebar rail**: the left rail returns with collapsed, compact, and expanded states plus drag-and-drop between rails.
- **Responsive canvas toolbar**: the toolbar collapses into a corner control when space is tight.
- **Workspace navigation shortcuts**: next/previous workspace bindings are customizable.

### Fixed

- **Persistent browser tabs**: webview-backed tabs stay mounted when switching, avoiding unwanted page reloads.
- **Detached macOS windows**: detached windows regain their header bar and controls.

## [1.4.0-beta.4] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Application chrome redesign**: window chrome, browser tabs, sidebars, and theme integration were reworked as one cohesive shell update.

## [1.4.0-beta.3] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Cate Agent sidebar home**: dedicated composer, chat tabs, navigation rail, and merge-target controls.
- **Agent-oriented Cate CLI**: the host API and CLI surface were reshaped around safe panel, terminal, browser, and workspace automation and enabled by default.
- **Structured verifier results**: Cate Agent checks report individual verdicts instead of a single opaque outcome.

### Changed

- **Consolidated application state**: legacy migrations and duplicated application systems were removed.

### Fixed

- **Canvas undo**: undo restores deleted panels rather than leaving ghost nodes.
- **Terminal GPU rendering**: glyph-atlas desynchronization and process-wide WebGL context overflow are contained.
- **macOS notarization**: native pi-agent addons are signed before packaging.

## [1.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Cate Agent chat motion**: the chat window now morphs cleanly into and out of the toolbar button with consolidated loading states.
- **Observer chat front door**: observer sessions can be selected and opened through the same chat surface.

## [1.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-07

First public beta of the toolbar-driven Cate Agent and extension platform.

### Added

- **Always-on Cate Agent**: workspace chat can observe work, launch parallel attempts, control terminals, manage worktrees, and resume jobs through a toolbar-anchored interface.
- **Extension system**: isolated, server-backed extension panels with permissions, storage, file-drop support, catalog provisioning, and agent conversation APIs.
- **Agent-facing browser and CLI control**: terminal agents and extensions can drive browser panels and scoped `cate` command groups.
- **Multi-repository Source Control**: repositories nested below a workspace root are discovered independently.
- **Worktree-aware navigation**: sidebars and the minimap group or color panels by worktree.

### Fixed

- **Terminal renderer exhaustion**: WebGL contexts are budgeted process-wide and fall back to the DOM renderer instead of producing blank terminals.
- **Canvas recovery**: corrupt saved geometry is ignored, selection/focus is unified, and group dragging remains stable.
- **Windows path handling**: allowed roots use native real paths so extension and workspace operations work across platforms.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Grow-to-fill placement**: recommended panel placement can expand into available canvas space.

### Fixed

- **Worktree restore authority**: the saved worktree tag determines a panel's working directory after reload.

## [1.3.2-beta.2] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **GPU text rasterization toggle**: users can disable GPU text rasterization when a driver or display setup renders text poorly.

### Fixed

- **Runtime startup**: the packaged runtime includes the complete file-watcher dependency closure and retries failed local starts.
- **Staged updates**: the updater stops rechecking once an update is downloaded, preserving the ready-to-install state.

## [1.3.2-beta.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Unified browser experience**: browser panels gain history, bookmarks, tabs, settings, and a start page.
- **OSC 52 clipboard support**: terminal applications can write to the system clipboard through OSC 52.
- **Worktree panel cleanup**: worktree removal and symlink creation clean up associated panels and metadata.

### Changed

- **Native recursive file watching**: workspace watching moved to a pooled native watcher to avoid descriptor exhaustion on large projects.
- **Canonical canvas selection**: focus, single selection, and group selection share one state model.

### Fixed

- **Terminal worktree restore**: restored terminals return to their worktree working directory.
- **Updater prompts**: downloaded-update prompts appear once per version rather than every polling interval.
- **Agent worktree switching**: a running agent moves with its selected worktree.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-15

Stability and editor release with hardened persistence, external-file conflict handling, refined shortcuts, and runtime packaging improvements.

### Added

- **External file-change handling**: editor panels detect disk changes and offer explicit reload/keep resolutions.
- **Editor customization**: configurable editor font family and copy buttons on Markdown code blocks.
- **Sidebar workspace controls**: expand or collapse all workspaces from the sidebar header.

### Changed

- **Runtime naming**: the remote companion was renamed and packaged consistently as the Cate runtime.
- **Telemetry notice**: packaged builds use informational always-on telemetry with a one-time census for existing installs.

### Fixed

- **JSON state reliability**: atomic writes retry transient Windows rename failures, and session restore tolerates damaged state.
- **Terminal redraw stability**: phantom resizes no longer duplicate full-screen TUI frames.
- **Hidden-file synchronization**: hidden files remain watched and resync when reopened.
- **Intel macOS runtime**: macOS packages include the x64 runtime built on the supported Intel runner.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Multi-node canvas selection**: marquee-select multiple panels, drag them as a group, and close the selection in one action.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Terminals keep their exact look across windows and restarts**: a terminal dragged into its own window — or reopened on the next launch — now restores its full buffer with colors and styling intact (not a plain grey dump), resizes to the new window so commands like `ls` use the right width, and prompts a full-screen program (Claude Code, vim, htop) to redraw its whole frame instead of showing a half-drawn one until you resize the window by hand.
- **No accidental duplicate workspaces**: opening a folder that's already open in another tab now focuses that tab instead of creating a second one that fought it over the same saved state.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-06-09

Bug-fix release for terminals detached into their own window.

### Fixed

- **Detached terminals no longer render blank or grey**: the GPU renderer now rebuilds and repaints once the new window is actually shown, instead of staying empty until the next output.
- **Detached terminal scrollback keeps its formatting**: replayed history is written with proper line breaks, so multi-column output (like `ls`) lines up again instead of cascading down the screen.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Modular main process and renderer state**: sessions, terminals, panel windows, the app store, and IPC bridge were split into focused modules.
- **Cross-window panels**: detached panel rows show live agent state, provider branding, ports, and worktree accents while keeping scrollback synchronized.

### Added

- **In-app update-ready modal**: downloaded updates offer restart-now or install-on-quit actions inside Cate.

## [1.2.5-beta.4] - 2026-06-08

Release-candidate rebuild of beta.3 with no additional user-facing changes.

## [1.2.5-beta.3] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Reliable update archives**: differential downloads are disabled to avoid partially assembled macOS bundles.
- **Lean native unpacking**: packaged native dependencies are limited to the required runtime floor.

## [1.2.5-beta.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Install-loop recovery**: repeated failed update installs now reach the manual-download fallback instead of resetting their retry counter forever.
- **Release availability**: macOS releases no longer wait on the end-to-end suite.

## [1.2.5-beta.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Self-healing updater diagnostics**: failed installs are persisted, retried, and eventually routed to a clear manual fallback, with a development update harness for verification.
- **Worktree identity on panels**: panel overlays expose the active worktree and apply its accent color.

### Fixed

- **Remote SSH parsing**: invalid key parser results no longer crash the connection flow.
- **Windows/Linux menu access**: frameless windows regain an accessible title-bar menu.
- **Canvas typing stability**: typing to the end of a line no longer shifts the canvas and exposes a background gap.
- **Agent setup errors**: missing pi-agent directories are not mislabeled as permission failures.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Remote SSH key workflow**: choose a private key with a native picker, validate its format, and get clearer disconnect logging.

### Changed

- **Curated skills catalog**: catalog sources require descriptions, duplicate rows are removed, and GitHub source links stay visible.
- **Command palette navigation**: keyboard navigation and action routing are unified across commands and overview panels.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Cross-agent skills manager**: discover and manage reusable skills for supported agents.
- **Multi-canvas sessions**: project sessions can persist and restore more than one canvas.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Custom Windows/Linux chrome**: frameless windows receive native-feeling window controls and a consistent themed title bar.
- **Themed placement picker**: placement previews and worktree colors follow the active theme.

### Changed

- **Stock updater path**: the custom updater UI was replaced with electron-updater's reliable install-on-quit flow and macOS recovery handling.

### Fixed

- **Saved layouts**: layouts apply to the active canvas rather than a stale/default canvas.
- **Window and terminal titles**: display names derive from folder names instead of full filesystem paths.
- **Dock tab sizing**: tab titles remain readable when no worktree pill is present.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Theme-aware agent surfaces**: agent UI colors track the active theme.
- **Snap-preview dragging**: drag previews show the eventual grid-snapped placement.

### Fixed

- **Update restart flow**: installing an update relaunches Cate, and the update affordance remains visible with an empty right sidebar.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Parallel-worktree toolbar**: create and manage worktrees directly from a canvas toolbar menu.
- **Friendly application errors**: common failures are translated into actionable messages.

### Changed

- **Simpler canvas model**: canvas regions were removed in favor of shared modal and placement primitives.
- **Spatial territories**: worktree territory outlines were slimmed down for a quieter canvas.

### Fixed

- **Cross-zoom dragging**: dock-to-canvas drag previews scale correctly for the destination canvas.

## [1.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-06

First beta of spatial worktrees and the hand-editable JSON persistence model.

### Added

- **Spatial worktree territories**: worktrees appear as live, colored canvas territories with tab pills and session persistence.
- **Hand-editable application state**: Cate settings and UI state moved to readable JSON files with consolidated provider preferences.
- **Hillside wallpaper**: a built-in canvas background joins custom background images.
- **Worktree-aware minimap**: terminals running agents display the agent icon.

### Changed

- **Single-source panel state**: panel, dock, canvas, and window records were consolidated to reduce conflicting state.
- **Cate Agent naming**: the former Pi Agent UI was renamed and its tooltips and shortcuts were cleaned up.
- **Sidebar layout**: the sidebar pushes dock content instead of overlaying it.
- **Update location**: update status moved to the right sidebar.

### Fixed

- **Panel creation shortcuts**: creation shortcuts work even when focus is outside the canvas.
- **Spatial selection and panning**: territory shapes, panning locks, and active-row behavior were refined.

## [1.1.1-beta.8] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **macOS signing identity lookup**: the release keychain is added to the search list before codesigning.

## [1.1.1-beta.7] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **macOS runtime notarization**: native companion binaries are signed before the app is notarized.

## [1.1.1-beta.6] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Release version consistency**: companion and pi-agent versions are synchronized before the application build begins.

## [1.1.1-beta.5] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Portable Windows packaging**: archive paths work across drive letters, duplicate native builds are avoided, and unsupported Intel macOS packaging was temporarily removed.

## [1.1.1-beta.4] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Windows archive naming**: release tarballs are created from a basename in their source directory rather than an absolute Windows path.

## [1.1.1-beta.3] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Windows tar invocation**: release archives use local-path mode so drive-letter paths are not parsed as remote hosts.

## [1.1.1-beta.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Windows binary staging**: packaged Node and ripgrep binaries are copied across filesystems instead of relying on a rename that can fail with `EXDEV`.

## [1.1.1-beta.1] - 2026-06-04

Large production-readiness beta introducing remote workspaces, saved layouts, content search, beta updates, and broad navigation polish.

### Added

- **Remote SSH and WSL workspaces**: connect to projects outside the local machine through the packaged runtime.
- **Saved layouts**: save and apply layouts from a dedicated dialog, empty-canvas picker, sidebar action, or native menu.
- **Content search view**: VS Code-style workspace search with keyboard navigation.
- **Keyboard canvas navigation**: move between panels and pan the canvas without reaching for the mouse.
- **Per-browser proxy**: each browser panel can use its own HTTP proxy.
- **Editable settings file**: open `settings.json`, edit it by hand, and see supported changes reload live.
- **Beta update channel and canvas backgrounds**: opt into prereleases and choose a theme-aware canvas image.

### Changed

- **Themed macOS title bar**: macOS consistently uses Cate's title bar instead of a separate native-tabs mode.
- **Searchable settings**: settings use sidebar navigation, search, fixed sizing, and scroll-spy highlighting.

### Fixed

- **Notification focus**: clicking an OS notification reliably brings its Cate window forward.
- **Command palette results**: file-name matches no longer starve content-search results.
- **Shortcut routing**: commands target the active canvas store, including new-file and VS Code/browser parity bindings.
- **Foreground terminal close protection**: closing a terminal with a running foreground process asks for confirmation.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-01

Polish release: grid snapping on the canvas, steadier sidebar and window handling, a big batch of new editor themes, and opt-in usage analytics for agent messages.

### Added

- **Snap to grid**: windows snap to a grid as you drag them on the canvas, so they line up cleanly without manual nudging. (#165)
- **Sidebar memory and tab menu**: the sidebar remembers its tab order and the active workspace, and a right-click menu lets you rename or close a tab. (#225, #193)
- **Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint**: point the agent at your own provider through a configurable endpoint. (#203)
- **Theme-aware window chrome**: native window chrome follows the active theme, with a new Dark Cold default. (#190)
- **Git decorations in the file tree**: VS Code-style status colors so you can read a file's git state at a glance. (#205)
- **More terminal controls**: a text-contrast setting and an Option-as-Meta toggle for macOS keyboards. (#206, #192)
- **New themes**: Clay Light and Clay Dark, plus Visual Studio Light and Dark, the One Dark Pro family, and One Light. (#210, #196)
- **One .cate gitignore**: a single `.cate/.gitignore` now covers session, agent, and worktree files. (#218)
- **Usage analytics for agent messages**: anonymous, opt-in tracking of how many messages are sent to agents. It records only the message kind, its length, and whether images were attached, never the message text, and you can turn it off in settings. (#244)

### Changed

- **Markdown preview follows the theme**: the preview now matches whichever theme is active. (#208)
- **Lighter idle cost**: idle terminals use less CPU and per-frame canvas culling is cheaper. (#201)
- **Shared window focus helper**: window restore and focus logic now lives in one place. (#230)
- **Removed legacy canvas panels**: dropped the obsolete git, file explorer, and project list canvas panels. (#226)

### Fixed

- **Deferred workspace activation**: activating a deferred workspace no longer wipes the canvas, and browser logins persist across sessions. (#220, #235)
- **Chat scroll position**: the agent chat keeps its place across refocus, with a new scroll-to-bottom button. (#233)
- **Shared-project reload loop**: two copies of Cate open on the same project no longer loop on reload. (#229)
- **Empty file tree on new workspaces**: the explorer retries its initial load, and nested folders refresh to match disk. (#212, #219)
- **Popover position and selectable replies**: chat input popovers stay correctly placed at any zoom, and chat replies can be selected. (#199, #189)
- **Terminal scroll and file drop**: the terminal keeps its scroll position across dock-tab switches, and external file drops insert a path again. (#202, #200)
- **Hand tool**: the Hand tool is fully inert, showing a grab cursor without firing clicks. (#207)
- **Sidebar polish**: header alignment, multi-select and delete, and scrollbar fixes. (#242)
- **Packaged builds**: the gh CLI resolves through the shell environment, and the subagent extension ships in packaged builds. (#198, #197)
- **Running-title shimmer**: stays white over worktree colors. (#234)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-29

Feature release: unified theming, a redesigned parallel-work flow, clickable terminal links, and configurable file exclusions.

### Added

- **Unified theming**: a single data-driven theme system covering app chrome, the terminal ANSI palette, and Monaco editor syntax tokens, alongside canvas tools, spatial navigation, and command palette polish. (#174)
- **Configurable file exclusions**: a new **File Explorer** settings section lets you edit the list of folder/file names hidden from the file explorer, file search, and change watching. The list persists across sessions, applies to every project, and updates open explorers live without a relaunch. Includes a "Restore defaults" action. (#155)
- **Redesigned parallel work**: a reworked tab, drag-to-canvas, PR support, and worktrees stored in `.cate`. (#182)
- **Open file paths from the terminal**: Cmd+Click a file path in the terminal to open it in the editor. (#180)
- **Clickable terminal links**: links in the terminal are now clickable, with a dialog to choose where to open them. (#178)
- **Close tab on middle-click**: middle-clicking a tab closes it. (#176)
- **Reload workspace from disk**: the `.cate` skill can configure the IDE, with a reload-from-disk action. (#170)
- **Per-workspace pi agent config**: pi agent configuration is scoped per workspace, with accordion provider settings. (#168)
- **Terminal scroll-speed setting**: a new setting controls xterm scroll sensitivity. (#185)

### Changed

- **Trimmed default file exclusions**: `dist` and `build` are no longer hidden by default. They are common names for hand-written source and config, and the previous exact-name match could silently hide files you wanted to see. The remaining defaults are unchanged: `.git`, `.DS_Store`, `.Trash`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.npm`, `.cache`, `.build`, `.swiftpm`, `DerivedData`, `Pods`. (#155)
- **UI polish**: squared top-level and nested cards, de-blued and softened pane glow, and calmer active-tab and terminal highlights. (#181, #179)
- **Performance tooling**: added a profiler and stress harness, and fixed zoom re-renders and terminal log I/O. (#173)

### Fixed

- **Markdown preview reset**: switching files now resets the markdown preview. (#186)
- **macOS line-editing chords**: line-editing chords are now delivered to the shell. (#177)
- **Split-terminal divider**: the divider no longer jumps on resize. (#171)
- **Terminal scroll under resize strips**: terminal scroll and scrollbar keep working under resize strips. (#160)
- **Drag and drop**: fixed canvas/workspace drag and drop and the empty-workspace note blink. (#166)
- **Terminal CPU usage**: cut sustained CPU and WindowServer usage from terminals. (#161)
- **Parallel-work title tint**: tint the title text rather than the icon. (#169)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-28

Patch release focused on agent process detection, parallel-work ergonomics, and a critical packaging fix for extension installs.

### Added

- **Broader agent detection**: the terminal now recognizes more coding agents as running, including Antigravity CLI, Forge Code, and node-script based agents (detected via `ps -o args`), in addition to the existing set.
- **Agent-aware terminal tabs**: terminal tabs running an agent show a dedicated icon and title, plus an awaiting-input dot when the agent is waiting on you.
- **Choose any base branch for worktrees**: when creating a new worktree for parallel work, you can now select any branch as the base instead of being limited to the default.
- **Project-local workspace state**: workspace layout is now stored in a `.cate/` directory inside the project, so canvas state travels with the repository.
- **Rename any panel from the tab menu**: the tab context menu gains a Rename action that works for all panel types, including panels in detached dock windows.
- **Unified accent palette**: workspaces and canvas regions now share a single consistent accent color palette.
- **Multilingual README**: added French, Simplified Chinese, and German translations of the README.

### Changed

- **Search folded into the command palette**: `Cmd+Shift+F` search is consolidated into the `Cmd+K` palette, giving one entry point for find and commands.
- **More reliable agent running state**: the agent's running indicator is now derived from PTY output streaming and the agent's own spinner, rather than brittle process heuristics, so it reflects activity more accurately.
- **Docs**: noted the deprecation of the Gemini CLI in favor of Antigravity.

### Fixed

- **Extension install crash in the packaged app**: installing an extension no longer fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (e.g. `cross-spawn`). The pi coding agent's full dependency tree is now unpacked from the asar so its modules resolve on disk regardless of npm's hoisting layout. (#150)
- **New Terminal worktree submenu**: the submenu now reflects the live git worktree list instead of a stale snapshot. (#145)
- **Forgiving resize hitbox**: floating panels are easier to grab and resize from their edges. (#147)
- **Dismissed terminal URLs stay dismissed**: URLs you dismiss from a terminal are no longer re-queued for confirmation. (#138)
- **Parallel tool-call shimmer**: all parallel agent tool calls now shimmer during the loading gap, not just the first. (#133)
- **Ctrl+C in terminal on Windows/Linux**: copies the selected text when there is a selection instead of always sending SIGINT. (#125)
- **Tab bar cursors**: clearer cursor feedback on the canvas-node tab bar. (#120)
- **Drag release tracking**: the window blur listener is bound in the bubble phase so drags end cleanly when focus leaves the window. (#119)

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-26

Patch release with Save-As for untitled editors, agent panel visual polish, and session persistence fixes.

### Added

- **Save-As for untitled editor buffers** — `Cmd+S` on a scratch editor opens a native Save-As dialog; subsequent saves reuse the chosen path. The close-confirm dialog's "Save" button also triggers Save-As for untitled buffers, and cancelling the picker keeps the panel open.
- **Per-window file grants** — files saved via Save-As outside the workspace are granted persistent read/write access scoped per window, surviving app restarts without widening the sandbox.

### Changed

- **Agent chat thread polish** — loading states with shimmer animation, smooth auto-scroll, and fade-in transitions for new messages.
- **Agent user message styling** — softer bubble background and text contrast for user messages; removed hover color override on thinking blocks.

### Fixed

- **Agent node session persistence** — agent panels now persist and restore correctly across app restarts.
- **Close-confirm dialog detail** — shows the on-disk path for a single dirty file, or a "Save will prompt for a location" hint for untitled buffers.
- **Save routing** — `Cmd+S` routes to the editor that most recently held Monaco text focus, not whichever editor passes `hasTextFocus()` at the key event.
- **Detached window Save-As sync** — Save-As in dock or panel windows syncs the new file path back to main for session persistence.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-26

Patch release with agent panel UI polish and minimap improvements.

### Added

- **Minimap click-to-focus** — clicking a node in the minimap now focuses and centers it on the canvas.
- **Browser panel local file support** — `file://` URLs and absolute local paths are now supported in browser panels.

### Changed

- **Agent chat thread redesign** — tool cards use a cleaner inline layout: bash commands show as compact single-line entries, diffs render with line numbers and colored add/remove backgrounds, and running tools pulse instead of showing spinner icons.
- **Inline retry indicator** — connection retry status moved from a banner above the editor into the chat thread with attempt count, delay, and an abort button.
- **Simplified chat sidebar** — removed background-session open/close controls from chat rows for a cleaner list.
- **Popover focus fix** — popovers inside canvas nodes (thinking level, model picker, stats) now lazily resolve their portal target instead of caching a stale DOM ref, fixing cases where popovers opened but couldn't receive clicks.

### Fixed

- **Auto-update download retry** — failed downloads now retry automatically and skip the dialog for patch updates.
- **README** — updated feature descriptions to cover agent panel, document panels, and current feature set; resolved leftover merge conflict markers.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-25

Patch release with new panel types, cross-platform fixes, and UI polish.

### Added

- **Document rendering panel** — new panel type for viewing PDF files (via pdf.js), DOCX files (via mammoth), and images natively on the canvas. File type is detected from magic bytes rather than relying solely on extensions.
- **Markdown preview in editor** — markdown files now show a Preview/Source toggle (top-right corner) that switches between Monaco editing and a rendered view using react-markdown with GFM support. The editor stays mounted while hidden so switching back is instant.
- **Themed titlebar drag strip on macOS** — when native tabs are off (now the default), a themed 28 px strip renders above the canvas with traffic-light alignment, collapsing automatically in native fullscreen.
- **Post-update dialog redesign** — shown on first launch (not just updates) with Product Hunt embed, GitHub star count, and newsletter links.

### Fixed

- **Ctrl+V paste in terminal panels on Windows/Linux** — xterm.js was encoding a literal `^V` (0x16) to the PTY instead of pasting. The custom key handler now yields to the browser's native paste event for the Ctrl+V chord on non-macOS.
- **Windows agent launch crash (spawn node ENOENT)** — pi's shell-less `spawn("node", ...)` couldn't find a `.cmd` wrapper on Windows. The shim now creates a real `node.exe` hardlink to the Electron binary.
- **Windows node shim without Developer Mode** — replaced symlink-based shim with a lightweight `node.cmd` batch wrapper that doesn't require admin/Developer Mode privileges.
- **OAuth flows blocked in webview** — Google and other providers block embedded webview sign-in. OAuth navigations now open in the system browser via `shell.openExternal`.
- **Closing a canvas node leaked its panels** — child terminals/editors/browsers stayed registered and running after the parent node was closed. `handleClose` now calls `closePanel` for every child before removing the node.
- **macOS microphone entitlement** — added `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` entitlement and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` so child processes (e.g. Claude Code voice input) can access CoreAudio.
- **Creating files/folders in an empty explorer folder** — the inline name-entry input was gated behind a non-empty tree; now renders when `rootCreating` is active.
- **CI build OOM** — set `NODE_OPTIONS --max-old-space-size` in the release workflow to prevent electron-vite bundling from running out of memory.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-24

First major release. Stabilises the agent panel, introduces semantic color tokens, and polishes the auto-updater.

### Changed

- **Semantic agent color tokens** — replaced hardcoded violet Tailwind classes with `agent` and `agent-light` color tokens defined in one place.
- **Agent panel polish** — automatic retry for marketplace fetch (cold connections often timeout on first attempt), increased timeout from 5 s to 8 s, and replaced native `<select>` for default model with the searchable picker used in the chat header.

### Fixed

- **Auto-update download fallback** — when electron-updater's initial check errors (e.g. provider mismatch), the fallback now broadcasts `available` instead of `manual`, so clicking Update attempts a native download first and only falls back to the release page if that fails.

## [0.4.13] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Native update retry first**: a failed update check now attempts electron-updater's native download path before offering a manual installer.

## [0.4.12] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Unified command palette (Cmd+K)** — merged the panel switcher (Cmd+E) into a single Cmd+K overlay that shows open panels, project files, and commands in the default view. Cmd+E removed.

### Fixed

- **Pi binary resolution in marketplace** — resolve directly to `cli.js` instead of `.bin` symlink which doesn't survive asar unpacking.

## [0.4.11] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Agent child process module resolution** — use Electron's binary with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` to spawn the pi agent child process, leveraging Electron's built-in asar support so transitive deps (like undici) resolve from inside the archive without unpacking.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Agent asar (attempt 3)** — disable asar entirely to fix child process module resolution failures in production builds.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Agent asar (attempt 2)** — unpack all `node_modules` from asar for child process spawning.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Agent asar (attempt 1)** — unpack `pi-coding-agent` from asar for production builds.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-05-23

Version bump only — no functional changes beyond agent panel fixes already shipped in the v0.4.6 cycle.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-05-23

Major feature release: in-app AI agent, git worktrees, canvas detach, and analytics.

### Added

- **Pi agent panel** — in-app AI agent powered by `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` with OAuth auth flow (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot), provider management, marketplace for extensions, chat thread UI, plan-mode install flow, per-chat model restore on resume, and a collapsible model picker grouped by provider.
- **First-class git worktrees** — new "Parallel Work" sidebar tab promoting git worktrees from a hidden primitive to a user-friendly concept. Per-worktree color identity, status badges (dirty/ahead/behind), actions to open terminal/agent, merge back, or delete. Canvas nodes show a worktree color pill in the title bar; terminal/agent icons tinted by worktree in sidebar and tabs.
- **Update analytics** — track update button clicks and feedback dismissals.

### Changed

- **Minimap redesign** — animated pill that expands in-place instead of the popover+button pattern. The `showMinimap` setting removed; the button is always visible.
- **Panel-type registry** — centralised per-type metadata so adding a new panel type is a two-touch change instead of editing a dozen switch statements. Net −239 LOC.
- **Workspace multi-select** — shift-click multi-select in the workspace list with bulk-delete via context menu.

### Fixed

- **Canvas detach preserves children** — detaching a canvas panel to its own window now transfers child panel states and canvas state (nodes, regions, viewport, zoom), so children render correctly instead of as generic stubs.
- **Canvas-on-canvas blocked** — dropping a canvas onto another canvas is now refused at three layers (data, commit, and receive) to prevent broken nested interaction.
- **Detached windows apply theme + settings** — `DockWindowShell` and `PanelWindowShell` now hydrate settings and subscribe to appearance mode changes.
- **Agent OAuth flows** — `shell.openExternal` fires on auth/device-code events; auth URL stays visible above the paste-code form instead of being clobbered.
- **Browser panel stability** — stabilise webview `src` to prevent re-navigation on re-render; ignore `about:blank` transient navigations; drop teardown `loadURL` that was clobbering session-restore URLs.
- **Dock tab bar padding in detached canvas nodes** — nested mini-dock tab bars no longer inherit the 78 px traffic-light reservation.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-21

Refactoring release: unified drag system, simplified surface area, and codebase cleanup.

### Changed

- **Unified drag/drop runtime** — new `src/renderer/drag/` module replacing `useNodeDrag`, `useDockDrag`, `CanvasDropZone`, `DragGhost`, `DropZoneOverlay`, and `dropExecution`. Cross-window aware with full unit and scenario test coverage. `DockTabStack` split from 889 lines into focused units (`DockTabBar`, `DockTabContextMenu`, `useDockTabActions`, `useDockTabDrag`).
- **OS-only notifications** — replaced in-app notification/toast system with native OS notifications; sidebar status simplified to running pulse + awaiting-input ring.
- **Terminal URL handling** — replaced auto-opening terminal URLs with a per-terminal inline prompt; setting becomes `off` | `auto` | `prompt` (default `prompt`).
- **Canvas grid** — removed grid snapping and line-grid style; grid is now a fixed-spacing decorative dot pattern.

### Removed

- **Canvas annotations and freehand drawings** — removed the annotation, drawing, and connection-wire feature set along with image-add IPC.
- **Sidebar file explorer** — removed the explorer sidebar toggle.
- **Bundled MCP registry** and `aiAssistEnabled` setting.
- **Unused IPC/preload surface** — `http:fetch`, `shell:which`, `session:clear`, `app:getPath`, `dialog:saveFile`, crash report save, and others.
- **Website and docs directories** — removed the separate marketing site and out-of-date design specs.
- **Dead code** — `bun.lock`, `animation.ts`, custom `ContextMenu.tsx`, `.claude/` artifacts.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Canvas drop zone overhaul** — accepts drops anywhere on the canvas (no pill gate); reserves a 60 px outer strip for dock indicators. Ghost preview matches the dropped node's real size. Source node hidden during drag.
- **Spring-load** — maximised canvas nodes un-maximise 200 ms into a drag so the canvas underneath becomes a drop target. Canvas tabs spring-activate at 250 ms.
- **Tab title resolution** — falls back to a fresh `appStore` read and panel-type label, so tabs no longer render as generic "Panel". Mini-dock layouts sweep orphan panel IDs.

### Fixed

- **Update & restart** — `quitAndInstall(false, true)` and `will-quit` handler now skip `reallyExit(0)` while an update install is in flight, so Electron's relaunch hook actually fires.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Terminal create failure retry** — a failed `terminal:create` no longer becomes a permanent tombstone. The half-built registry entry is torn down and a "Failed to start terminal" overlay with a Retry button is shown. Retry re-runs `getOrCreate` from scratch without requiring an app restart.
- **Explorer tracked-file dimming** — `gitLsFiles` returns repo-relative paths but the tree used absolute paths, so the tracked-files set never matched. Now prefixed with the repo root.
- **Windows shell resolution** — enhanced fallback logic for finding a usable shell on Windows.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Inline update progress** — the update pill is now the sole affordance (no popover). Click while available starts the download; progress fills inside the pill; on completion, auto-triggers `quitAndInstall` so the app restarts to install.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Toolbar and welcome page centering** — now inset by sidebar widths so they center within the visible canvas area as sidebars open/close.
- **Minimap popover palette** — uses canonical brand palette instead of muted floating-mode tones.
- **Recent-folder open race** — welcome page awaits `setWorkspaceRootPath` before `createTerminal`, so the terminal reliably gets the right cwd.
- **Welcome page reappearing** — gated on `workspace.rootPath` being empty, so an initialised workspace shows a blank canvas instead of the start page.
- **Per-workspace canvas focus** — sidebar now resolves the workspace's own canvas store when computing children and jumping to panels.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-18

First release after the v0.3 series. Focus: error reporting, auto-updater, canvas drawing, and codebase simplification.

### Added

- **Sentry crash reporting** — replaced the homegrown crash reporter with Sentry (`@sentry/electron`). DSN via env var; gated by a `crashReportingEnabled` setting (default on).
- **Auto-updater UI** — in-app update pill in the canvas toolbar. Main-process auto-updater broadcasts status (idle/checking/available/downloading/downloaded/manual/error); renderer subscribes and renders the pill.
- **Freehand pencil drawings** — pencil tool for drawing strokes directly on the infinite canvas. Strokes live in canvas-space, pan/zoom with the workspace, and support click-to-select, drag, color palette, and delete.
- **Terminal URL auto-open** — scans PTY output for URLs and routes them to an existing browser panel (or creates one). Gated by `autoOpenUrlsFromTerminal` setting (default off). Includes a portal registry for driving existing webviews.

### Changed

- **Removed AI config and MCP subsystem** — stripped AI configuration UI, MCP server management, and all related IPC/types/preload bindings.
- **Removed usage tracking** — deleted usage-tracking popover, IPC channels, types, and related sidebar UI.

### Internal

- Coordinate system unit tests (`canvasToView` / `viewToCanvas` / `viewFrame`).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-13

Patch release with one canvas-placement papercut.

### Fixed

- **New panels always opened to the right of the focused one**, even when an empty slot sat directly above, below, or to the left. `findFreePosition` in `canvasStore` now rays out in all four cardinal directions from the reference node, jumps past obstructing nodes along each ray, and returns the slot whose center is closest to the reference — so opening a terminal next to a focused panel uses whichever side actually has open space.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-13

Patch release with a single terminal-startup fix.

### Fixed

- **"Failed to create terminal: path is outside allowed directories"** — `setWorkspaceRootPath` applied the new `rootPath` optimistically in the renderer but the main-process `workspace:update` that registers the path with `allowedRoots` is async; a `terminal:create` firing in that window failed `validateCwd` in main and surfaced as a red error in the terminal panel (with a restart as the only workaround, because `SESSION_LOAD` preemptively re-adds persisted roots). `terminalRegistry.getOrCreate` now awaits a new `awaitWorkspaceSync()` helper exported from `appStore` before sending `terminal:create`, so any pending workspace create/update lands first.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-13

Patch release with two papercut fixes from the v0.3.0 cycle and a file-explorer feature.

### Added

- **File explorer copy/paste** — Copy / Paste entries on the file, folder, and root-background context menus, backed by a new `FS_COPY` IPC that uses `fs.cp` recursively with collision-safe renaming (`copy`, `copy 2`, …). Multi-select copy supported. Paste is disabled when the clipboard is empty.

### Fixed

- **Folder double-click no longer opens every direct child as a tab** — folders now ignore double-click; single-click still toggles expansion.
- **New terminal opens in the picked folder, not `$HOME`** — `setWorkspaceRootPath` only flipped `isRootPathPending` locally and waited for the main-process IPC roundtrip before exposing `rootPath`, so `WelcomePage` spawning a terminal right after picking a folder mounted the panel before the path was readable and the PTY fell back to `os.homedir()`. Now applies `rootPath` (and the derived name) optimistically before the IPC roundtrip.
- **"Cate crashed unexpectedly" dialog after a clean shutdown** — React 18's `logCaughtError` wraps thrown DOM `Event`s as `"Uncaught [object Event]"`, but the existing renderer filter only matched the bare `"[object Event]"` form, so a single non-Error throw during teardown persisted a crash report and resurfaced the dialog on next launch. Extracted `isNonInformativeMessage()` (also matches `"Uncaught [object Object]"` and the generic `^Uncaught \[object …\]$` shape) and applied it on both the `window` error path and the `ErrorBoundary`.

### Internal

- **Renderer source maps in production builds** — crash-report stacks now point at real source locations instead of opaque bundle offsets, which we need to track down whoever is throwing the raw `Event` in the first place.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-21

First minor release since the open-source drop. Major focus: unified **Spotlight-style overlays** (command palette, canvas-wide search, panel switcher, saved layouts, MCP editor), **startup resilience** (shell fallback, git-monitor crash, crash-report loop), and a handful of long-standing papercuts.

### Added

- **Canvas-wide search** (`Cmd+Shift+F`) — Spotlight-style multi-source search across workspace files, live terminal scrollback, and open panel titles/paths. Recent-focus ranking (the currently-focused panel always wins), colored type-tile icons per result, inline section dividers. Shortcut is intercepted in the capture phase so it works from inside Monaco and xterm. `toggleFileExplorer` moved to `Cmd+Shift+X` to clear the collision.
- **Saved Layouts manager** — in-app modal (`Cmd+K → "Saved Layouts…"`) for naming, saving, loading, and deleting canvas arrangements (nodes, regions, zoom, viewport). Stored in electron-store; replaces the old `window.prompt` / native "Save As…" dialogs. Matches the search overlay's visual language.
- **Editor buffer persistence for scratch editors** — unsaved content in filePath-less editors survives canvas switches, workspace switches, and app restarts. Stored on the panel itself and round-tripped through the existing session save.
- **Editor tab breadcrumb** — thin strip above Monaco showing the workspace-relative path split into segments (`folder › folder › file.ts`). Hidden for diff mode and scratch editors; full absolute path in the tooltip.
- **Panel switcher (Cmd+E) includes dock-zone panels** — File Explorer, Git, Project List, and Canvas host panel appear alongside canvas nodes. Selecting a dock item reveals its zone (unhiding if collapsed) and activates the correct tab.
- **MCP server editor dialog** — modal for adding and editing `.mcp.json` entries with a full environment-variable key/value list, parsed-args preview, and an inline **Validate** button that spawns the server, probes `initialize`, and shows `serverInfo` + advertised capabilities (tools / resources / prompts / logging) + protocol version. Writes nothing to disk during validation so users can iterate safely.
- **Phase 3 orchestrator plan** committed under `.claude/plans/phase-3-orchestrator.md` so the roadmap travels with the code.

### Changed

- **Command palette, canvas-wide search, saved layouts, and MCP editor** now share one Spotlight-style chrome: `rounded-3xl`, bright `white/20` outline, `backdrop-blur-2xl`, integrated magnifying-glass icon, bolder input text, type-tinted circular icon tiles on each row, inset selection highlight. Three overlays, one visual language.
- **Panel switcher masonry** — replaced the horizontal-scrollbar strip with a centered wrapping grid. Tiles are uniform width (220 px) with heights following each node's real aspect ratio (clamped). Off-screen nodes get a type-tinted placeholder icon instead of a blank tile so every tile conveys what it represents.
- **Dock tab bar** — each tab now carries a type-colored icon (terminal / editor / browser / git / explorer / projects / canvas). Active tab gets a 2 px bright-blue top accent and `font-medium` label. Overflow is handled by flex-shrink + truncate — no more horizontal scrollbar on narrow nodes. Thin inter-tab dividers for rhythm.
- **MCP test probe** now returns server capabilities instead of discarding the `initialize` response — `MCPTestResult` includes `serverInfo`, advertised capability flags, and protocol version.
- `defaultShellPath` default flipped from `/bin/zsh` to `""` (auto-detect) — meaningful on Linux where `/bin/zsh` often isn't installed.

### Fixed

- **Crash-report dialog loop** — `"Cate crashed unexpectedly"` was popping up on every packaged-app launch because `tryUnlink` silently swallowed deletion failures, leaving the report on the pickup path for the next startup. Now atomically renames the pending report into the archive as the *first* step, before parsing or dialog. Cross-device rename falls back to copy+unlink; last-resort delete on failure; all `tryUnlink` failures now log. Renderer side also filters resource-load failures (no more `[object Event]` noise reports) and dev mode skips the dialog entirely.
- **Shell fallback with user-visible banner** — when `defaultShellPath` points at a missing or non-executable binary, terminals used to die instantly with a cryptic `execvp(3) failed.` New `resolveShell()` validates the configured path, falls back through a platform chain, and surfaces a yellow banner inside the PTY explaining what happened and where to fix it. Includes `shellResolver.test.ts` (12 tests) covering the fallback paths.
- **Git monitor crash on unregistered root** — session restore could race ahead of the main-process allowed-roots registration, causing `validateCwd` to throw inside an `ipcMain.on` handler. With no promise boundary, the throw escaped as an uncaught exception and Electron showed a fatal dialog. Now wrapped in try/catch — monitor just doesn't start for the affected workspace, recoverable by re-opening the folder.
- **Git panel stale branch list** — the monitor only emitted updates when the *current* branch or dirty flag changed, so `git branch -d foo` in an external terminal left the sidebar showing `foo` until the next remount. Now also tracks the full local branch list and emits on any membership change. Three poll calls now run in parallel via a small `runGit` wrapper.
- **Shortcut collision** — `Cmd+Shift+F` was bound to both `globalSearch` (new) and `toggleFileExplorer` (historical). The matcher returned `toggleFileExplorer` first, so the new overlay never opened. Moved file-explorer toggle to `Cmd+Shift+X`.
- **Saved-layouts load regressions** — `closeAllPanels` nuked the canvas host panel too, leaving a blank dock center; restored via `ensureCenterCanvas`. Sync calls to `createTerminal/createEditor/createBrowser` then raced ahead of the new canvas's React mount, so nodes landed on the disposed store; now `ensureCanvasOpsForPanel` + `setActiveCanvasPanelId` are called synchronously to anchor the new canvas before nodes are created.

### Internal

- 13 PRs across the release (#3–#5, #7–#15). One commit per feature on main via squash-merge. All commits follow conventional-commits formatting with why-not-what bodies.
- CI builds green across `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest` for every merged PR.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-04-15

Security and stability hardening release across workspace trust, filesystem boundaries, crash reporting, and continuous integration.

### Added

- **Workspace session trust**: restored sessions are checked before project-controlled state is applied.
- **Crash-report archive**: renderer and main-process crashes are retained with a bounded history for later diagnosis.
- **Electron smoke tests and unit coverage**: CI verifies application startup plus git, path-validation, and session-trust behavior.

### Changed

- **Tighter filesystem sandbox**: workspace roots, web security, feature flags, and preload IPC contracts were hardened together.

### Fixed

- **Release icon generation**: restored the Cate logo asset required by the packaging pipeline.

## [0.2.17] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Clean application exit**: corrected the final quit/exit call and silenced the production console logger.
- **Release asset publishing**: repaired the workflow that attaches platform builds to a release.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **File explorer drag-and-drop moves**: move files and folders directly in the explorer and create new entries relative to the clicked folder.

### Fixed

- **Terminal lifecycle leaks**: PTYs and terminal resources are released on crashes and abnormal teardown.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Safe shutdown**: normal quits no longer trigger `SIGABRT`.
- **Continuous session persistence**: active session state is saved throughout the run instead of relying only on final shutdown.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Long-session memory usage**: terminal loggers, usage watchers, and caches now release resources when their owners close.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Processes and ports overview**: the sidebar can show running workspace processes and listening ports in one popover.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Quit-time session restore**: workspace state is flushed reliably before exit.
- **Zombie child processes**: terminals and other spawned processes are terminated when Cate closes.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Embedded browser loading**: the renderer content-security policy no longer blocks browser-panel objects required by Electron webviews.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Canvas, docking, and workspace integration**: refined the in-progress multi-window layout and workspace state flow.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Faster startup**: an inline splash paints before the renderer loads, panel-window restoration is deferred, panel chunks preload in parallel, and background scans wait until idle.

### Fixed

- **Usage scan scope**: usage watchers limit directory depth and ignore unrelated files.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Fullscreen event typing**: corrected Electron fullscreen listener signatures so the release builds typecheck cleanly.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Electron 41.2.0**: updated the desktop runtime to the current 41.x patch release.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-04-08

Broad work-in-progress stabilization release across docking, the sidebar, updater UI, and usage tracking.

### Added

- **Usage view and model pricing**: inspect usage from the sidebar with model-cost metadata.
- **Dirty-editor close confirmation**: editor buffers register save handlers and warn before being discarded.
- **Visible-panel autofocus**: the largest visible canvas node can receive focus automatically.

### Fixed

- **Updater progress window**: install progress remains visible, closes reliably, and allows enough time for disk-image installation.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Electron 41**: upgraded the desktop runtime and refreshed native packaging.
- **Sidebar polish**: workspace naming and navigation received a visual cleanup.

### Fixed

- **Crisp terminal fitting**: resize work is coalesced and terminal rendering remains sharp at high canvas zoom.
- **Workspace rename**: renamed workspaces persist and display correctly.
- **macOS signing inputs**: the entitlements file is included, and icon generation handles the current `png-to-ico` export.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Fallback installer**: when the native updater fails, Cate can download and launch a platform installer directly.

### Fixed

- **Windows installer launch**: detached installers use `spawn` so they survive Cate exiting.
- **Panel drag ghost**: the cross-window drag preview follows the cursor accurately.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Terminal scrollback restore**: terminal history is replayed when panels or sessions return.
- **Canvas annotation colors**: annotations can carry distinct visual accents.
- **Isolated development data**: local development no longer shares the packaged application's user data.

### Fixed

- **Terminal scrolling**: restored and focused terminals keep the intended viewport position.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **File explorer background menu**: right-click empty explorer space to create a file or folder.

### Fixed

- **Terminal scroll retention**: focus changes no longer jump the terminal viewport.
- **Deferred workspace notifications**: notification actions retry until a lazily restored workspace is ready.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Structured logging**: renderer and main-process events use a shared logging pipeline.
- **Filesystem path validation**: file operations are constrained to registered workspace roots.

### Changed

- **Session reliability**: closing child windows flushes their state before teardown.

### Fixed

- **Notification error colors**: error notifications use the correct status-dot type.
- **Terminal, browser, resize, and docking polish**: corrected several early multi-window lifecycle edge cases.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-02

Major architecture release introducing detachable windows and a VS Code-style docking model.

### Added

- **Multi-window shells**: main, panel, and dock windows share a registry and route to the correct renderer shell.
- **Four-zone docking**: left, right, bottom, and center zones support split layouts and tab stacks.
- **Cross-window panel transfer**: drag panels between windows while preserving terminal scrollback, browser state, and editor position.
- **Canvas panels**: canvases became first-class panels that can live in a dock zone.
- **Persisted window layouts**: dock layouts, detached windows, and multi-workspace state restore across launches.
- **Shell environment resolution**: terminals inherit paths from common version managers and package-manager installations.

### Changed

- **Main-owned workspaces**: workspace records moved to the main process as the shared source of truth.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Notification center**: in-app toasts, OS notifications, a bell popover, and notification preferences.
- **Generic coding-agent detection**: terminal activity recognizes Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and OpenCode.
- **Terminal file drops**: drop operating-system files or file-explorer entries into a terminal to insert their paths.

### Fixed

- **Browser panel interaction**: focus, saved URLs, and wheel-event passthrough work reliably.
- **Terminal input and rendering**: Option-as-Meta, WebGL recovery, scroll retention, and shortcut isolation were corrected.
- **Directory drops**: folders no longer create invalid editor panels on the canvas.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **Updater outcomes**: update-available, up-to-date, and error results all produce clear feedback.
- **Release publication order**: a release is published only after every platform build finishes.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Full Source Control panel**: push, pull, branch, stash, and diff workflows are available inside Cate.

### Changed

- **Canvas performance**: reduced unnecessary work during common canvas interactions.

### Fixed

- **Panel scrolling**: wheel input scrolls the focused editor, terminal, or browser instead of panning the canvas.
- **Release reuse**: CI skips release creation when the target release already exists.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-31

### Changed

- **Focused initial scope**: removed unfinished features and the early AI chat panel from the release build.

### Fixed

- **Panel switcher colors**: all supported panel types map to a valid color.
- **Release assets**: the pipeline uploads packaged files instead of publishing an empty release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Automatic updates**: packaged builds can discover and install newer Cate releases.
- **Collapsible sidebar**: reclaim canvas space without closing sidebar tools.

### Changed

- **Browser URL handling**: entering and normalizing addresses is more forgiving.

### Fixed

- **macOS quarantine guidance**: documented the workaround for unsigned/quarantined early builds.
